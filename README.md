# CollegeSalaries_DataScienceProj
Group Project-- Exploratory data analysis (Python, Javascript, D3, topoJSON, HTML, CSS) on the salaries of college graduates based on the type of schools they attended, the fields they majored in, and the location of their schools. 

## My parts of the Project 
- Data preprocessing: Merging datasets and cleaning the resulting dataset (Python)
- Created The Map Visualization (Javascript, D3, topoJSON, HTML, CSS)
- Wrote the design rationale for Map graph
